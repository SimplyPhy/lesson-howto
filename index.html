        <h3>Toss two tightly packed cups of your favorite leafy greens into a blender</h3>

        <h3>Add water and blend until all leafy chunks are gone</h3>
        <p>
          It's best to blend your leafy greens with water before you add fruit so that you can be sure to get a smooth finish.  A smoothie is supposed to be smooth, after all!
