# [My Recipe]

Students create a recipe of their choosing (e.g. favorite food) and build a webpage that lists the necessary ingredients, followed by pages that demonstrate the steps to make the meal.  
  
The initial phase includes a complete basic webpage.
The second phase adds a sidebar for navigation.
The third phase changes the view to horizontal and adds nav buttons.
The fourth phase allows serving size inputs that adjust the quantities.
The fifth stage adds a homepage to add additional recipes.
The sixth stage allows new recipes to be made from the website.
